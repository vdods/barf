// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// BARF general
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- change "general XXX parse error" into "general XXX parse error -- please
  report to xxx@yyy.com" so error reporting can be better
- move anything specific to BARF that is currently in core out of core and
  into a "common" directory (or think of a better name).  this will better
  separate and formalize the dependencies of each system.
- add optional-argument commandline options, and account for empty-argument
  required-argument options (e.g. `./reflex -I ""` will assert)
- descriptions should be indicate "finite-automata-based scanners" and
  "pushdown-automata-based parsers"
- error when any output file is the same as an input file
- shorten the enabled_verbosity names (and rename scanning/parsing spew to
  scanner/parser)
- add dot graph generation for ASTs
- add recursive block comments into barf_commonlang_scanner.reflex (think
  about how this will interact with other-languaged code blocks)
- rename OutputDir to OutputDirectory once the other options have been
  deprecated (this looks like it will happen once old trison is deprecated)
- add _barf_version to preprocessor shit?
- add targetspec versions -- so you can have multiple coexisting versions of
  the same target but at different versions.
- config.h-specified search path
- move trison/reflex stuff into lib/trison and lib/reflex? and only keep
  main, options and main header file in app dir (so test apps can link the
  libs and run tests)?  put stuff in Barf::Xxx namespace
- rename more stuff to be shorter?
- get rid of empty xxx_enums.xpp files (once BARF is near complete)
- move all AST usage to smart pointers to ease-ify stuff and to escape the
  woes of memory leaks (not like it matters that much in this context) --
  or do comprehensive deleting of stuff (which would probably set a better
  example for people who read the source code of the parsers/scanners).
- get rid of AST hierarchy overviews once doxygen docs are to some decent state
- use Ast::Directive::GetDirectiveString in error messages instead of
  creating the error messages by hand -- make all directives derive from
  Ast::Directive
- add "execution debug spew" mode for each program, which says what it's doing,
  e.g. opening files, doing type checking, env vars its using, etc
- file locations should be "2d range" -- a starting line/column and an ending
  line/column.  nonterminal expressions can then be the union of the file
  locations of their component parts.  this technique will be useful later in
  compiler design for debugging info.
- add metaprogramming stuff for integer types and compile time asserts
- make all AST classes dumb storage containers with external, non-member
  functions which operate on them (unless it's more practical to use member
  functions in a particular case).  this will make the separation of systems
  clearer.
- add some path-checking function -- i.e. to check for newlines and other stuff

// commonlang

- target directives (including rule handlers) should accept multiple targets
  like
  %target.cpp_nostl,cpp_withstl,cpp_noexceptions %{ blah %}

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// core
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- typedef Graph::Node::Index as a struct or an enum with a value
  UINT32_UPPER_BOUND (to force it to be unsigned) and use that everywhere for
  node index values.
- in util's GetEscapedString, make it read overflowed hex chars
- move trison's conflict messages into barf_message.h/cpp
- make a GraphNodeIndex vector type in barf_graph.h (replacing the ad-hoc
  vector<Uint32> used all over the place)

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// targetspec
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- allow using the value of previously declared directive ids as default values
- confirm that the declared name matches the filename -- or, should the 
  targetspec's %target directive be removed (it is redundant) -- probably remove
- add new "add_optional_codespec" directive which requires the directive
  id of an add_optional_directive, for optional output files (like
  baseclasses which could be common to multiple parsers/scanners), then change
  add_codespec into add_required_codespec
  OR
  think of a good way to specify not-very-often-changing baseclass-like
  files which may be common to many parsers/scanners
- add error handling to the parser grammar

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// preprocessor
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- add some way to use a different file location for errors/warnings
- add comments (C++ and C style)
- make _blah ids not be able to be defined in-file, they're reserved
- add redefine directive so you can do stuff like
  @<redefine(x)>@@<x+1>@@<end_redefine>@
- add eval directive so you can parse and execute a block of text as a preprocessor body.
- add "-[ \t\n]*2147483648" as a scanner token, so that number can be scanned
- add assignment operator? to do stuff like @<x=3*y>@
- add similar looping construct for arrays?
- caching for integer values on symbols (so getting the integer value of
  a symbol dereference is faster)
- maybe make the Textifier detect if a newline was just printed, so that
  it doesn't print unnecessary newlines when generating line directives
- see if the scanner can be half hand-scanned and half reflex-scanned, so that
  only the "code" portions are reflex-scanned.  this will allow for flexibility
  in defining the code section delimiters
- change <*{ into <*| or <| so it doesn't screw up brace matching
- includes should use search path
- add default value for Body::Body()'s file_location param as
  FileLocation::ms_invalid, so it doesn't have to be specified explicitly
  everywhere
- in symbol table dump, don't print out the AT_BODY part, only the AT_TEXT or
  AT_INTEGER or whatever.
- add boolean property for wether or not a particular symbol was referenced
  during preprocessing.

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// regex
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- consider getting rid of \a \b \f \r \v and only having \t and \n, so that
  conditionals can use \a \b etc.
- emit error/warning when a non-printable char is encountered in a regex
  (must use a hex code instead)
- in graph printing, TT_INPUT_ATOM_RANGEs which include [ or ] as the ending
  char need to escape them
- generally fix up the escaping of characters in display strings and graphs
  to escape in the context of the regex.
- attempt to get rid of the initial epsilon transitions currently required
  in each regex
- make a parse-string method which returns a Regex::RegularExpression and
  possibly throws to indicate errors.
- use \c and \C to turn case sensitivity off/on -- this would not be a
  state-machine-determined thing, but it would influence character classes
  and such.
- implement ungreedy matching
- fix up the \x stuff in the scanner (disallow \x alone, require a hex char)
- allow '\0' as a transition atom -- this will allow usage of regexes for
  binary data.  this will also require some thought, since the current
  implementation depends on '\0' being disallowed.
- rename _nfa/_dfa_node_* to _nfa/_dfa_state_*
- move NodeData into separate file

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// bpp
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- add -D define options (like the C preprocessor)

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// grope
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- write it

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// reflex
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- add option for line directives referencing codespecs (the default should be
  to refer to codespecs, for easier development)
- add thing that checks for EOF-handling in each scanner mode?
- add a no-STL-usage C++ target (?) -- should be configurable by a targetspec 
  directive -- currently it only uses std::string and std::deque.  std::string
  will be trivial to replace with null-terminated strings.  replacing std::deque
  will require writing a deque implementation (which is fine, because then it
  can be optimized for characters and copying strings out of it).
- add option which prints the (reflex) targets available in the current search path
- add codespec macro of the regex for each rule
- use smallest integer type to store state and transition indices, etc.
- add _reflex_version to the code generator (_barf_version?)
- the rule handler code block type should be specifiable by the targetspec
- add -D option for defining crap in the preprocessor stage -- before and
  after the .reflex source is read (e.g. to override the output filenames)
- warn about targetspec directive values that weren't referenced in the
  code generation (preprocessor) stage -- ones that don't appear at all in
  any codespec, not necessarily to indicate they weren't used in one particular
  case.
- add "push accepted string back into buffer" API to the generated scanner -- 
  should it be allowed push any string?  maybe not, since it will have to have
  the previous char.  but maybe that's ok.

// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// trison
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- figure out how to guarantee branch uniqueness per Action_ branch list in C++ parser.
- add default values in trison cpp targetspec for Scan implementation
- change "%prec %left BLAH" into "%prec.left BLAH" (and maybe prec into precedence)
- NPDA: each action node in the tree gets a set of precedences.  when a node's
  child set changes, the precedence set is updated, and then conflict resolution
  can happen
- you shouldn't have to specify %token 'X' for ascii chars.  you should
  just be able to use them (or maybe add as option)
- specifying any %target.xxx directive seems to add the target; stop this
- rename _accept_handler_code to _rule_code (or something), and generally
  consistencize the nomenclature of the NPDA preprocessor symbols in general
- add option for line directives referencing codespecs
- get rid of STL usage in C++ codespecs (separate target)
- the rule handler code block type should be specifiable by the targetspec
- add option which prints the targets available in the current search path
- rename %token to %terminal (and friends)
- require %nonterminal keyword before nonterminal definition
- add %end keyword which matches the builtin terminal END_
- old trison: END_ shouldn't be acceptable by %error
- old trison: take out default reduction rule handler return (it blocks the
  'no retval' compiler warning)
- check for reduction rule variable name collisions
- call throw-away-token-actions on all tokens in token stack during parser
  destructor and at the end of the parse method
- update the output basename help message
- add -D option for defining crap in the preprocessor stage -- before and
  after the .trison source is read (e.g. to override the output filenames)
- make directives parseable in any order?
- add a directive for what to do with unnamed tokens (because they might need
  to be thrown away)
- get rid of trison_message (and move the crap into barf_message)
- warn about targetspec directive values that weren't referenced in the
  code generation (preprocessor) stage -- ones that don't appear at all in
  any codespec, not necessarily to indicate they weren't used in one particular
  case.
- rename _npda_node_* to _npda_state_*
